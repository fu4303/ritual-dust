I am Lizbeth Poirier, a designer, musician and maker / crafter

I am currently taking commission work for **design**, **illustration**, **lettering** and **web** projects (especially anything relating to folklore, occultism, activism music and art).

I am also crafting ritual tools and small handcrafted wooden items which you can find here.

To discuss those, email me at: lizbeth.poirier.m@gmail.com

This website is part portfolio, part digital garden and part recipe blog. It is where I collect and expand upon my thoughts and discoveries, and where I showcase what I create, craft and conjure.

My past work experience includes working as a UI/UX and graphic designer in startups such as FoodRelay, Tangea, and l'Institut du Leadership en e-learning.

I've worked as an art school technician, building woodworking shops, teaching woodworking, animation, 3D modelling, playing with 3D printers and helping students realize their creative ideas no matter what medium they required.

I am part of the Montr√©al interactive community and I've done talks and shared my process at some of their events.
