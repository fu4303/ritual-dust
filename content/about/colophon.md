### Fonts

When selecting fonts for this website, I was looking to combine my love for 70's psychedelia and gothic blackletter while keeping everything mostly legible and accessible.

Fonts used on this website:  
**Juniper Std** is used for the bigger titles  
**Cal Fraktur Modern** is used for blackletter titles  
**Cooper Std** is used for the second level of titles  
**Distro** is used for the third level of titles  
**Wrenema** is used for body text

If you're into cool fonts look up [this directory of open source fonts by womxn](https://www.design-research.be/by-womxn/) and this [crazy foundry making free fonts](https://www.velvetyne.fr/).

### Technology

This website is basically a collection of html files in folders, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I'm currently in the process of getting rid of all javascript on it and optimize the images to make it lighter and faster to load.
I also plan to move away from AWS for hosting because fuck Jeff Bezos.
