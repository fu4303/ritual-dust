### Fonts

When selecting fonts for this website, I was looking to combine my love for 70's psychedelia and gothic blackletter while keeping everything mostly legible and accessible.

Fonts used on this website:  
[**Basteleur**](http://www.velvetyne.fr/fonts/basteleur/) is used for the bigger titles  
**Cal Fraktur Modern** is used for blackletter titles  
**Cooper Std** is used for the second level of titles  
**Distro** is used for the third level of titles  
**Wrenema** is used for body text

If you're into cool fonts look up [this directory of open source fonts by womxn](https://www.design-research.be/by-womxn/) and this [crazy foundry making free fonts](https://www.velvetyne.fr/).

### Technology

This website is basically a collection of html files in folders, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It does not require javascript to run. The files are hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and the domain on [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en).

Here is some improvements I'm planning for the future:

<div class="checklist">

- [ ] Graceful degradation for older browser not supporting css3
- [ ] Switch all icons to svg instead of a font
- [ ] Load smaller images by default with an option to get the hi-res ones

</div>
