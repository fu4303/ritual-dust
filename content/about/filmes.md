intro = "This is a collection of films that impacted me by their stories, characters and/or art direction. I take a lot of inspiration in my work and in the music I collaboratively create for Blood and Dust from movies both old and new. I've also been collecting screenshots from movies for the longest time, as a kind of keepsake of the most striking scenes and compositions."
