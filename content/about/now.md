These days I'm learning Russian, working on this very website,
cooking plant-based [fall food](/tags/fall/), practicing woodcarving and making plans for a converted van.
I also make truly devastating and highly emotional music as [Blood and Dust](http://blood-and-dust.com) with [Hayley Evans](http://hayleyevans.net).

I try to keep this page up to date with my current interests and projects, visit often and feel free to reach out to me on [mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@ritualdust) to discuss these.
