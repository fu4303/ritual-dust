My new sigil, created as part of my gender transition process breaks away from the rigidity and cleanness of the previous symbol, embracing imperfections and intuition in it's drawing. It's elements intersecting and colliding without being constrained.

The oil and sugar symbol originates from an old stylized signature from my
art school years. While doing some research on alchemical iconography I
realized that the two symbols formed by this combination of the letters T
O & M corresponded to the alchemical symbols for oil and sugar, hence the
name.
