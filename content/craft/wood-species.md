First and foremost, the most sustainable form of timber is reclaimed wood.
Good sources of reclaimed wood are wooden pallets (usually built with hardwoods such as ), timber from demolition of buildings and barns, old furniture.

Notes on sustainably harvested timber: buying European wood is usually a good choice because they’ve been putting legal measures in place to enforce replanting of trees and better forest management and limiting annual harvests (need source).
