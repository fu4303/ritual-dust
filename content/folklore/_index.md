Here will be collected some of the writings I find useful to share, most probably a mix of lived experiences, hyper-specific knowledge, occult practices and teachings. As I move forward in life I give myself the intent to use my voice more, be it to express internal desires and ideas, connect with like-minded people or share my knowledge and inspire others to build the things that lacks in this world.

> “In the field of the truly esoteric, words are the sigils of power that form as the inner world takes outer form. They develop a greater meaning and purpose as we formulate the grand sum of experience into singular flowing points. Even the act of writing is itself a magical act, a ritualistic focusing and a scriptural act of devotion.”

> "But "art" is not art. "Art" is politics that has created new styles of communication."
