What worked for me in life so far, and what I want to try in the future.

- **Cultivating a relationship with nature**   
- **Learning to listen, name and express my feelings**   
- **Growing a practice of gratitude**
- **Develop an awareness of privilege and power dynamics**
- **Realize that insecurities always comes from ignorance of self**

> “Listen to me, your body is not a temple. Temples can be destroyed and desecrated. Your body is a forest—thick canopies of maple trees and sweet scented wildflowers sprouting in the underwood. You will grow back, over and over, no matter how badly you are devastated.”
**― Beau Taplin**
