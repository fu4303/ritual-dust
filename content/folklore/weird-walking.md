The [Weird Walk zine](https://www.weirdwalk.co.uk/) put a name on something I've always loved to do, wander around cities and nature, following previously unknown paths, keeping my eyes and my mind open for new experiences and noticing weirdness when I encounter it.

I want to keep an irregular log of some of my weird walks here and add notes and references of previous weird walkers.
