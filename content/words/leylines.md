I've been curious about leylines ever since hearing about them in Children of the stones. While researching them I found the work of Alfred Watkins who popularized the idea in his book The old Straight Track. Of course, leylines in the sense of lines of energy circling the earth and connecting ancient pagan monuments have been debunked by archeologists, but they are still interesting to explore be it even just for how they change our relationship with the landscape.
